Collection DS do not supports primitives.
List also do not support any primitives.

-is index based class, internally uses array.
 has index for retrieving is faster than any other DS.
 array list is automatically growing or shrinking

 - Takes Wrapper class


 has methods:
 add() - adding objects into the arrayList increasing by 1
 size()
 get(index ) - retrieving specific element from the list
 indexOf()
 set(index, newIndex) - replaces the element of the array list at given index into the new element
 remove() - is not able to remove element based on index # because of the collections,
           collections is dynamic DS  and will shift element
 clear()
 lastIndexOf()
 contains()
 equals()
 isEmpty()
 containsAll()
 addAll()
 removeAll()
 retainAll()

removeIf() - accept index number to remove elements from collection and internally use iterable
//removeIf(Predicate): removes all the elements from the ArrayList that are matching wit the given predicate condition
Predicate has Test() returns boolean T/F
