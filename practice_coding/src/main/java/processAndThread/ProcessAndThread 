Process and Thread:

Process: is a Operating system that runs process
--Programs that are scheduled for execution in the CPU
--An instance  of a program running on a computer
--A process has code, data, and help others segments.

THREAD:
--Thread is a subset of process(threads comme with the process and shares all resources with the process)
--A Sequence of execution whit in a process(any action with the process is creating the thread)
--Every single process at least have one thread
--Shares all resources of process

Multi_Threading
    --Two or more threads are being executed with the process
    (program running, process is executing more than one thread)

Multi-Tasking  definition:

Two or more process are being executed within the operating system

Synchronized (Thread-safety)
    --Process of controlling the access of multiple thread to any share resources
    --Only one thread to access the shared resource at a time (Thread -safety)
    --the rest of the treads are waiting   for lock
    (if 4 different threads being created with in the process if i synchronized them,
    each of the threads get access the resources one at the time.
   (if i don't synchronized them all threads could  access resources at the same time)
