ITERABLE

Iterable is parent interface of Collection
--Allows the object to be iterated by using Iterator (third way if iterating collections)
--Iterator is used when we want to remove elements whilst
    we Iterate over collections
--The reason we use Iterator is when we are removing element

 from collection index number keeps changing, once
 we remove one element previews index number no longer referencing next elements
in that case we use Iterator

How to use Iterator?

--We can obtain the Iterator by using the iterator() method of an Iterable
--Iterator provides the ready methods that
can be used while traversing the collection:
        hasNex(); // boolean
        next();
        remove();
