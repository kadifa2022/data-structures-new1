Data Structures: to use data efficiently

1.Array
2.Collection
3.Map

        Containers of the Data Structure

 Array vs Collection vs Map
        1. Array:
            -Size is fixed
            -supports both primitive and non Primitive data types
            -Can be multi- Dimensional
            -Faster (random access)

            -disadvantages of array:
                -size is fixed
                -does not have available methods for array

        2. Collection:
        -OF individual objects
            -size is dynamic
            -supports non_primitive data types ONLY
            -Can NOT be multi-dimensional
            -ready methods

        3. Map:
        -Map is Collections OF pairs(key and values) Entry
               -size is dynamic
               -supports non-primitive data types ONLY
               -Can NOT be multi-dimensional
               -ready methods

   Java is not 100% object oriented
