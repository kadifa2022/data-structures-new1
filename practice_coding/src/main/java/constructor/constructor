constructor is special method, no return types
to call instances from object we need to create constructor with parameters
because we want to initialize fields(instance variables) of the class with our own values.

 other wise

we need to call each instance separate one to set it( not efficient way)

constructor name has to be the same as the class name all the time.
 we are using the constructors to set the fields of the objects and we pass Arguments/ fields in parameter.
 to call the instance variable we use the name local/instance variable
 this. key word
 this. name = name;

 Default constructor does not have parameter.
